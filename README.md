Udacity's Deep Reinforcement Learning Nanodegree - Project 1: Navigation

## Project Details

### State Space
The state space is continuous and 37-dimensional. The dimensions capture the velocity of the agent, and includes ray-based perception of objects around the agent's forward direction.

A reward of +1 is achieved by the agent for collecting a yellow banana, with a -1 reward if the agent picks up a blue banana.

### Action Space
There four actions for the agent to choose from at each time step:

0 - walk forward 
1 - walk backward
2 - turn left
3 - turn right

### When is the enviornment solved?
The environment is considered "solved" when the agent is able to receive an average reward, over 100 episodes, of at least +13.
